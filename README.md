# Chris King-Parra, Aspiring DevOps Engineer

I'm a student training to become a DevOps engineer. My core skills are Linux, programming, problem analysis, written communication, and a methodical approach to learning. In August I'll begin a nine month intensive course on AWS, IaC tools, and python programming.

My main motivation to work in technology is fellowship with other problem solvers. I want to create and participate in an environment that engenders continual self-improvement. I also enjoy diving deep into technologies starting from their original design goals, in order to appreciate them from a philosophical perspective.

As part of my studies, I've developed a few areas of special of interest, including:

* Applying ideas from the purely functional and data-flow programming paradigms to make large systems easier to understand.
* Declarative server management that is actually declarative.
* Seeing how far the idea of infrastructure as code can go.
* Securing SSH credentials using certificate authorities and bastion hosts.
* Tracking live SSH sessions using network tracking, eBPF, and the Linux audit subsystem.
